# restlink

A python library that helps automate the exposure of backend resources like databases via a REST API.

Restlink aims to complete the critical last leg of automation between Marshmallow schema's, SQL alchemy, and
a REST API exposed on Flask and adhering to OpenAPI. This task is somewhat conditional and I suspect that
any attempt to do it truly universally will result in frustration. This small library is my own take on this
problem and tailored to my own needs. Perhaps some other person with similar needs might use it one day.
